# Database-lab-course-project
This is the project for my database lab (IT3290E) course at HUST. Where i worked as the leader for the group and designed the entity relationship diagram, table and field from the group's topic proposal
For this github, i only upload the part i mainly worked on for the project
# Technique employed
When working on this project, i mainly used what i have taught myself previously on the subject of OLTP database design, this include:
- Gathering and documenting required business process information (While in this course we had to make up a business process ourselves following the professor's guidance, i used what i knew was needed to include in the business process)
- Extracting required entities and their characteristics
- Assigning the correct fields to their table
- Identifying and resolving problematic fields such as multivalued and multipart fields
- Establishing relationship and how to represent those relationship as tables in the database
- Defining relationship characteristics (deletion rule, type of participation, degree of participation,...)
- Documenting table, fields
